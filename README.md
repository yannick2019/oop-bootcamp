# OOP Bootcamp

## Learning Objectives
Applying OOP is something you can only learn by using it and experimenting with different options. We'll tackle some use cases and see how we can go about them to get you familiar with it.

## The mission
This exercise consists of multiple use cases. It's recommended to have one repo, and have multiple folders in there to contain everything.

## Use Case #1
A basket contains the following things:
- Banana's (6 pieces, costing €1 each)
- Apples (3 pieces, costing €1.5 each)
- Bottles of wine (2 bottles, costing €10 each)
  
Without using classes, do the following in your code:
- Calculate the total price
- Calculate how much of the total price is tax (fruit goes at 6%, wine is 21%)
  
Next, do the same with classes. What style do you prefer? Do you notice any difference in time needed to code, structure or readability? From now on, if nothing is stated specifically, it's recommended to use classes.

## Use Case #2
Consider the same basket as in use case 1. The shop owner wants to have a way to have 50% off every fruit. Can you find a way to implement the discount once, and re-use it efficiently for every fruit?

## Used Tech
- JavaScript
- node js
